# How To Learn Machine Learning

### If you are taking a more **mathematics based** approach, I would recommend these resources:
- [3Blue1Brown Neural Network Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
- [Andrew Ng Machine Learning Course (My Top Choice)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [Brilliant.org Machine Learning Course](https://brilliant.org/courses/machine-learning/)
- [MIT Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njKP3FqW3Sk&list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI)

### If you want a more **project based** approach, check out these resources:
- [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)
- [DeepLearning.ai Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
- [Practical Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvk-72jrjBFGbV2Ndi1LFmLVJxHBDTXUD)
- [Siraj Raval's Watch Me Build Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A4n3aP_rzgqA8lVGknkSN2p)
- [Google's Keras Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Ok8p463C4&t)

Once you feel like you have gotten the basics of machine learning down, try creating some of these projects:
1. Stock price predictor
2. Handwritten digit classifier
3. AI medical diagnoser
4. Housing price predictor
5. Predict someone's age
6. Content recommendation system
7. College admissions predictor
8. Object classifier using YOLO
9. Video game bot using OpenAI Gym and Reinforcement Learning
10. Advanced Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing
11. Or better yet **create a machine learning course of your own!**
